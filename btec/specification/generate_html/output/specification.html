                  <p class="editable">This new suite introduces additional features to meet the needs of educators, employers and the external environment.

               <p class="editable">BTEC First qualifications were originally designed for use in colleges, schools and the workplace as an introductory level 2 course for learners wanting to study in the context of a vocational sector. This is still relevant today. The knowledge, understanding and skills learned in studying a BTEC First will aid progression to further study and prepare learners to enter the workplace in due course. Potential employment opportunities, such as an apprenticeship or a supervised role (depending on the specific job requirements), should be available in the information technology sector and appropriate parts of the creative industries, such as computer games development. These BTEC First qualifications provide learners with a taste of what these sectors can offer, enabling them to make informed choices about their future career.</p>
               <p class="editable">These qualifications are intended primarily for learners in the 14&#x96;19 age group, but may also be used by other learners who wish to gain an introductory understanding 
                of a vocational area. When taken as part of a balanced curriculum, there is a clear progression route to a level 3 course or an apprenticeship. 
            </p>
               <p class="editable">BTECs are vocationally related qualifications, where learners develop knowledge 
                and understanding by applying their learning and skills in a work-related context. Additionally, they are popular and effective because they engage learners to take responsibility for their own learning and to develop skills that are essential for the modern-day workplace. These skills include: teamworking; working from a prescribed brief; working to deadlines; presenting information effectively; and accurately completing administrative tasks and processes. BTEC Firsts motivate learners, and open doors to progression into further study and responsibility within the workplace.
            </p>
               <p class="editable">The BTEC First suite continues to reflect this ethos and builds on the recommendations outlined in the Review of Vocational Education &#x96; The Wolf Report (March 2011) and further emphasised in the Department for Education&#x92;s Study Programmes for 16&#x96;19 year olds consultation (June 2012). These reports confirmed the importance of a broad and balanced curriculum for all learners.</p>

                    and Creative Technology include two externally assessed units in the core to introduce
                    externality into vocational programmes of study. This will assist learners as they progress
                    either into higher levels of vocational learning or to related academic qualifications, such
                    as GCSEs and GCEs.</p>
                  <p class="editable">The assessment approach for the internally assessed units in the qualification structure
                    enables learners to receive feedback on their progress throughout the course as they
                    provide evidence towards meeting the unit assessment criteria. These units include a
                    Digital Portfolio unit (Unit 3), which is assessed synoptically, and must include learner&#x92;s
                    work from all complete units from their course. Internally assessed units (optional
                    specialist units) provide a common approach to understanding existing technology
                    products/systems through investigation, and then allow learners to design, make
                    and review their own technology-based product or system.</p>
                  <p class="editable">Delivery strategies should reflect the nature of work within the IT sector by encouraging
                    learners to research and carry out assessment in the workplace, or in simulated working
                    conditions, wherever possible. It will be beneficial to learners to use locally available
                    vocational examples wherever possible, and for your centre to engage with local
                    employers for support and input. This allows a more realistic and motivating basis
                    for learning, and can start to ensure that learning serves the needs of local areas.</p>
                  <p class="editable">Learners should be encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning and

                        ultimately into employment. The vast majority of employers require learners to have
                        certain technical skills, knowledge and understanding to work in a particular sector,
                        but they are also looking for employability skills to ensure that employees are

                    <p class="editable">Unlike technical skills, which may become outdated over time, employability skills

                        economy. These skills include: self-management, team working, business awareness,
                        problem solving, communication, basic literacy and numeracy, a positive attitude to
                        work, and the use of IT.</p>

                  <p class="editable">Your approach to teaching and learning should support the specialist vocational nature of BTEC First qualifications. These BTEC Firsts give a balance of practical 
                    skill development and knowledge requirements, some of which can be theoretical 
                    in nature.
                </p>
                  <p class="editable">Instruction in the classroom is only part of the learning process. You need to reinforce the links between the theory and practical application, and make sure that the knowledge base is relevant and up to date, by using teaching methods and materials that allow learners to apply their learning to actual events and activities within the sector. Maximum use should be made of the learners&#x92; experience where relevant, for example by encouraging them to reflect on their experience of work or the experiences of family and friends.</p>
                  <div class="describedlist">
                     <p class="editable">One of the important aspects of your approach to delivery should be to instil into learners who have a limited experience of the world of work some insights into the daily operations that are met in the vocational area being studied. It is suggested that the delivery of the BTEC Firsts can be enriched and extended by the use of learning materials, classroom exercises and internal assessments that draw on current practice in and experience of the qualification sector being studied.

                  <p class="editable">An assessment instrument is any kind of activity or task that is developed for the sole purpose of assessing learning against the learning aims. When you develop assessment instruments you will often be planning them as a way to develop learners&#x92; skills and understanding. However, they must be fit for purpose as a tool to measure learning against the defined content and assessment criteria to ensure your final assessment decisions meet the national standard.</p>
                  <p class="editable">You should make sure that assessment tasks and activities enable learners to produce valid, sufficient, authentic and appropriate evidence that relates directly to the specified criteria within the context of the learning aims and unit content. You need to ensure that the generation of evidence is carefully monitored, controlled and produced in an appropriate timescale. This will help you to make sure that learners are achieving to the best of their ability and at the same time that the evidence is genuinely their own.</p>

                  <p class="editable">You should ensure that authenticity is considered when setting assignments. For example, ensuring that each learner has a different focus for research will reduce opportunities for copying or collaboration. On some occasions it will be useful to include supervised production of evidence. Where appropriate, practical activities or performance observed by the Assessor should be included.</p>
                  <p class="editable">Learners must authenticate the evidence that they provide for assessment. They do this by signing a declaration stating that it is their own work when they submit it. For practical or performance tasks observed by the Assessor this is not necessary.</p>
                  <p class="editable">Your Assessors should assess only learner evidence that is authentic. If they find through the assessment process that some or all of the evidence is not authentic, they need to take appropriate action, including invoking malpractice policies as required.</p>
                  <p class="editable">It is important that all evidence can be validated through verification. This means that it must be capable of being reassessed in full by another person. When you are using practical and performance evidence, you need to think about how supporting evidence can be captured through using, for example, videos, recordings, photographs, handouts, task sheets etc.</p>
                  <p class="editable">The authentication of learner evidence is the responsibility of your centre. If during external sampling an Edexcel Standards Verifier raises concerns about the authenticity of evidence, your centre will be required to investigate further. Depending on the outcomes, penalties may be applied. At the end of this section, you can find an example of a template that can be used to record the declaration of learners in relation to the authenticity of the evidence presented for assessment.</p>

                  <p class="editable">The assessment criteria are not a set of sequential activities but a way of making a judgement. For example, if a Level 2 Pass specifies a &#x91;description&#x92; and a Merit an &#x91;analysis&#x92;, these do not require two different activities but rather one activity through which some learners will provide only description evidence and others will also provide analysis evidence.</p>

                    having additional time to complete assignments. You are not required to accept

                  <p class="editable">A learner may be given one opportunity to retake a completed assessment after a summative grade has been given. Your centre will need to provide a specific assessment opportunity that is authorised by the Lead Internal Verifier. You should make arrangements for retaking the assessment in such a way that does not adversely affect other assessments and does not give the learner an unfair advantage over other learners. You need to consider how the further assessment opportunity ensures that assessment remains fit for purpose and in line with the original requirements.</p>

            <p class="editable">Technology systems can include a multitude of external hardware devices and internal hardware components. Over time it is necessary to maintain the system to repair faults (such as a loose component) and improve performance or upgrade the system&#x92;s functionality (for instance by installing a faster processor). Job roles that demonstrate installing and maintaining computer
            hardware include computer technician, technical support engineer, service team leader, and helpdesk engineer. </p>
            <p class="editable"> In this unit, you will develop an understanding of the benefits and implications of installing and maintaining hardware in technology systems. For a specific brief, you will install and maintain hardware in a technology system. This will involve finding and repairing faults with the internal hardware components of a computer, such as the processor or internal bus, and upgrading
            other internal components, such as adding a network card or additional memory. You will also learn how to install a new external hardware device, such as a printer or barcode scanner. </p>
            <p class="editable">The technology system will then be tested for functionality and performance. Once completed, you will review your modified technology system against the brief and obtain feedback from the &#x91;client&#x92;, and evaluate possible improvements. </p>
            <p class="editable">In particular, this unit develops skills from Unit 2: Technology Systems and supports Unit 11: Computer Networks, Unit 15: Installing and Maintaining Computer Software and Unit 16: Automated Computer Systems. </p>

                            <p class="editable">teachers should recognise that the process of installing, maintaining and testing hardware in technology systems is an iterative one.</p>
                            <p class="editable">Learners should refine the modified technology system in order to improve its performance. Learners are also expected to make further refinements based on their test results and feedback. These refinements will probably involve customising the hardware components to suit the &#x91;client&#x92;. Other refinements could include accessing the advanced settings of the
                                hardware components to see if they can be customised to make full use of their features and capabilities in a way that satisfies the &#x91;client&#x92; or user, for example, by using software drivers to optimise a graphics card that takes full advantage of memory and processing power. This can be achieved by either reallocating physical memory resources or utilising USB flash
                                drives to extend and support the memory, for example, ReadyBoost. Cleaning the internal hardware components, such as the power supply unit or heat sink, will also improve the performance of a technology system and prevent any overheating caused by particle build-up.</p>
                            <p class="editable">If it is not possible for learners to apply their refinements (for example, because of software or hardware constraints), learners should explain what they would do if they had the opportunity, focusing on performance. For example, the scarcity of highperformance graphics cards could prevent learners from refining the modified technology system. However, they
                                could discuss how these graphics cards would improve performance with an explanation of how they would be configured.</p>
                            <p class="editable">All of the ideas from testing, reviewing and receiving feedback on the modified technology system should be considered as learners go through the refinement process.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="editable">Source &#x96; QCDA (archived)</p>
                <p class="editable">The framework comprises six groups of skills that are essential to success in learning, life and work. In essence, the framework captures the essential skills of: managing self; managing relationships with others; and managing own learning, performance and work. It is these skills that will enable young people to enter work and adult life confident and
                    capable.</p>
                <p class="editable">The titles of the six groups of skills are set out below.</p>
                <p class="editable">For each group, there is a focus statement that sums up the range of skills. This is followed by a set of outcome statements that is indicative of the skills, behaviours and personal qualities associated with each group.</p>
                <p class="editable">Each group is distinctive and coherent. The groups are also interconnected. Young people are likely to encounter skills from several groups in any one learning experience. For example, an independent enquirer would set goals for their research with clear success criteria (reflective learner) and organise and manage their time and resources effectively to achieve these
                    (self-manager). In order to acquire and develop fundamental concepts such as organising oneself, managing change, taking responsibility and perseverance, learners will need to apply skills from all six groups in a wide range of learning contexts.</p>
