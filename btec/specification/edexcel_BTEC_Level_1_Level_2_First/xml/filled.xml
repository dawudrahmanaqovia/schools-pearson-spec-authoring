                    <list_description>The core units form the fundamental knowledge and understanding of IT/computing
                        principles and, when completed, provide synoptic coverage of the qualification. In
                        addition, centres have the flexibility to select optional specialist units to reflect the
                        breadth of opportunity within the sector and enable further exploration of specific
                        areas of interest. These units combine to provide the following four pathways:</list_description>

                <paragraph>Learners taking the Extended Certificate qualification, benefit from learning about
                    different types of IT and computing technology from across the different pathways.
                    Understanding how different IT and computing technologies interact and interrelate
                    provides learners with further opportunities for synoptic learning, which would benefit
                    their progression to level 3 and eventually into employment.</paragraph>

                        <item>
                            <paragraph>Unit titles containing the words ‘Creating Digital’ (Units 4, 5, 6 and 7) involve making computer-based product(s) that do not require a user interface.</paragraph>

                        <item>
                            <paragraph>Unit titles that include the word ‘Development’ (Units 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 17) involve making a computer-based product that does require a user interface.</paragraph>

                            <paragraph>Unit titles containing the word ‘Computer’ (Units 11, 14, 15, 16) involve working with both computer hardware devices and software to make/maintain a system.</paragraph>

                <describedlist>
                    <list_description>The optional specialist units are either 30 GLH or 60 GLH. Most of the ‘Development’
                        units are 60 GLH, as they require, in addition to a user interface, more in-depth skills,
                        knowledge and understanding than the ‘Creating Digital’ units, which are 30 GLH. There
                        are two exceptions to this as follows:</list_description>

                            <paragraph>Unit 8: Mobile Apps Development is 30 GLH, so that it can be paired with one of the ‘Creating’ units in the Award to produce a simple app.</paragraph>

                            <paragraph>Unit 9: Spreadsheet Development is 30 GLH, as learners will probably already be familiar with the software tool/techniques from Key Stage 3 and from the application of spreadsheets across the curriculum.</paragraph>

                </describedlist>
                <paragraph>All the ‘Computer’ units are 60 GLH, owing to the complex nature of the technology,
                    which involves both computer hardware and software.</paragraph>
                <paragraph><strong>Note:</strong> The Edexcel BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First Certificate and Extended Certificate can
                    be taken as stand-alone qualifications or can be ‘topped up’ from the Edexcel BTEC
                    Level 1/Level 2 Award in Information and Creative Technology with additional units
                    to make up the requisite number of guided learning hours. For details of the rules of

            <title>Assessment approach</title>
            <text>
                <paragraph>The Edexcel BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First Certificate and Extended Certificate in Information
                    and Creative Technology include two externally assessed units in the core to introduce
                    externality into vocational programmes of study. This will assist learners as they progress
                    either into higher levels of vocational learning or to related academic qualifications, such
                    as GCSEs and GCEs.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The assessment approach for the internally assessed units in the qualification structure
                    enables learners to receive feedback on their progress throughout the course as they
                    provide evidence towards meeting the unit assessment criteria. These units include a
                    Digital Portfolio unit (Unit 3), which is assessed synoptically, and must include learner’s
                    work from all complete units from their course. Internally assessed units (optional
                    specialist units) provide a common approach to understanding existing technology
                    products/systems through investigation, and then allow learners to design, make
                    and review their own technology-based product or system.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Delivery strategies should reflect the nature of work within the IT sector by encouraging
                    learners to research and carry out assessment in the workplace, or in simulated working
                    conditions, wherever possible. It will be beneficial to learners to use locally available
                    vocational examples wherever possible, and for your centre to engage with local
                    employers for support and input. This allows a more realistic and motivating basis
                    for learning, and can start to ensure that learning serves the needs of local areas.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Learners should be encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning and
                    achievement, taking account of the industry standards for behaviour and performance.</paragraph>

                <text>
                    <paragraph>One of the main purposes of BTEC qualifications is to help learners to progress
                        ultimately into employment. The vast majority of employers require learners to have
                        certain technical skills, knowledge and understanding to work in a particular sector,
                        but they are also looking for employability skills to ensure that employees are
                        effective in the workplace.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Unlike technical skills, which may become outdated over time, employability skills
                        enable learners to adapt to the ever-changing roles needed to survive in the global
                        economy. These skills include: self-management, team working, business awareness,
                        problem solving, communication, basic literacy and numeracy, a positive attitude to
                        work, and the use of IT.</paragraph>
