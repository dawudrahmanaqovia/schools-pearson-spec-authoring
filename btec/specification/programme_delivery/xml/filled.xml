        <text>
            <paragraph>Edexcel does not define the mode of study for BTEC qualifications. Your centre is free to offer the qualification using any mode of delivery (such as full-time, part-time, evening only or distance learning) that meets your learners’ needs. As such, those already employed in the information technology sector or some aspects of the creative industries (such as working with computer animations) could study this qualification on a part-time basis, using industry knowledge and expertise gained from the workplace to develop evidence towards meeting the unit assessment criteria.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Whichever mode of delivery is used, your centre must ensure that learners have appropriate access to the resources identified in the specification and to the subject specialists who are delivering the units. This is particularly important for learners studying for the qualification through open or distance learning.</paragraph>

                <list_description>When planning the programme, you should aim to enhance the vocational nature of the qualification by:</list_description>

                        <paragraph>using up-to-date and relevant teaching materials that make use of scenarios and case studies relevant to the scope and variety of employment opportunities available in the sector. These materials may be drawn from workplace settings, where feasible </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>including employers in the delivery of the programme. You may, for example, want to invite guest speakers from a range of local employers working in both the information technology sector and appropriate parts of the creative industries, e.g. software businesses developing computer games, enabling learners to gain an insight into the world of work</paragraph>

            <title>Delivery approach</title>
            <text>
                <paragraph>Your approach to teaching and learning should support the specialist vocational nature of BTEC First qualifications. These BTEC Firsts give a balance of practical 
                    skill development and knowledge requirements, some of which can be theoretical 
                    in nature.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>Instruction in the classroom is only part of the learning process. You need to reinforce the links between the theory and practical application, and make sure that the knowledge base is relevant and up to date, by using teaching methods and materials that allow learners to apply their learning to actual events and activities within the sector. Maximum use should be made of the learners’ experience where relevant, for example by encouraging them to reflect on their experience of work or the experiences of family and friends.</paragraph>
                <describedlist>
                    <list_description>One of the important aspects of your approach to delivery should be to instil into learners who have a limited experience of the world of work some insights into the daily operations that are met in the vocational area being studied. It is suggested that the delivery of the BTEC Firsts can be enriched and extended by the use of learning materials, classroom exercises and internal assessments that draw on current practice in and experience of the qualification sector being studied. This 
                        may include:

            <text>
                <paragraph>Your learners have opportunities to develop personal, learning and thinking skills (PLTS) within a sector-related context. See Annexe A for detailed information about PLTS, and mapping to the units in this specification.</paragraph>

            <title>English and mathematics knowledge and skills</title>
            <text>
                <paragraph>It is likely that learners will be working towards English and mathematics qualifications at Key Stage 4 or above. This BTEC First qualification provides further opportunities to enhance and reinforce skills in English and mathematics in naturally occurring, relevant, work-related contexts. </paragraph>
                <paragraph>English and mathematical skills are embedded in the assessment criteria – 
                    see individual units for signposting to English (#) and mathematics (*), Annexe B 
                    for mapping to GCSE English subject criteria (including functional elements) and Annexe C for mapping to the GCSE mathematics subject criteria (including 
                    functional elements).

            <title>Functional Skills at level 2</title>
            <text>
                <paragraph>Your learners can use opportunities within their learning programme to develop and practise Functional Skills. Annexe D sets out where units and learning aims are of particular relevance for learners being prepared for assessment in Functional Skills in English, mathematics and/or ICT at level 2. There may also be other opportunities to develop functional skills in programmes, for example through group work, research, employment-related activities and work experience.</paragraph>
