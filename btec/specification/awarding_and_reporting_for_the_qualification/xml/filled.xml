            <text>
                <paragraph>This qualification is a level 2 qualification, and the certification may show a grade ranging from Level 2 PP to Level 2 D*D*. (Please refer to the Calculation of qualification grade table for the full list of grades.†)</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If these are not achieved, a Level 1 grade may be awarded. Learners whose level of achievement is below a Level 1 will receive an Unclassified (U) result.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The qualification grade is calculated on the basis of grades in individual units. Each unit will be awarded a grade of Level 2 Pass, Level 2 Merit, Level 2 Distinction or Level 1. Learners whose level of achievement is below a Level 1 will receive an Unclassified (U) for that unit. There is no unit grade of D*; grades of D*D and D*D* can be awarded as an aggregated grade for the qualification based on the learner’s overall performance. In order to achieve this grade, learners will have to demonstrate a strong performance across the qualification as a whole.</paragraph>

                    <paragraph>Edexcel will automatically calculate the qualification grade for your learners when your learner unit grades are submitted. Learners will be awarded qualification grades for achieving the sufficient number of points within the ranges shown in the Calculation of qualification grade table.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph>Example: </paragraph>
                    <paragraph>A learner achieves a Level 2 Pass grade for a unit. The unit size is 30 guided learning hours (GLH). Therefore they gain 12 points for that unit, i.e. 4 points for each 
                        10 GLH, therefore 12 points for 30 GLH.
