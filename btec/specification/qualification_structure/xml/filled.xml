            <paragraph>Some units for the Pearson BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First Diploma qualification only appear in this qualification size, while other units are included in the smaller qualification sizes within the suite. The ‘Summary of units’ table (see Annexe F) lists each unit in the suite and how it is used within individual qualifications, i.e. whether the unit is core, mandatory (Mand), optional specialist (Opt), or not included (—). </paragraph>
            <paragraph>The qualification structure shows the permitted combinations for the qualification and for the endorsed titles for particular pathways. </paragraph>
            <paragraph>If a learner has already achieved a BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First Award, Certificate or Extended Certificate qualification within the same sector, they may carry forward their unit results for use in this qualification. It is the responsibility of the centre to ensure that the required number of guided learning hours – 480 GLH in total – and correct unit combination are adhered to. </paragraph>
