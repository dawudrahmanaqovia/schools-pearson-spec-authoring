                <paragraph>The majority of the units in this qualification are assessed through internal assessment, which means that you can deliver the programme in a way that suits your learners and relates to local need. The way in which you deliver the programme must also ensure that assessment is fair and that standards are nationally consistent over time.</paragraph>

            <text>
                <paragraph>An assessment instrument is any kind of activity or task that is developed for the sole purpose of assessing learning against the learning aims. When you develop assessment instruments you will often be planning them as a way to develop learners’ skills and understanding. However, they must be fit for purpose as a tool to measure learning against the defined content and assessment criteria to ensure your final assessment decisions meet the national standard.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>You should make sure that assessment tasks and activities enable learners to produce valid, sufficient, authentic and appropriate evidence that relates directly to the specified criteria within the context of the learning aims and unit content. You need to ensure that the generation of evidence is carefully monitored, controlled and produced in an appropriate timescale. This will help you to make sure that learners are achieving to the best of their ability and at the same time that the evidence is genuinely their own.</paragraph>

            <title>Authenticity and authentication</title>
            <text>
                <paragraph>You can accept only evidence for assessment that is authentic, i.e. that is the learner’s own and that can be judged fully to see whether it meets the assessment criteria.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>You should ensure that authenticity is considered when setting assignments. For example, ensuring that each learner has a different focus for research will reduce opportunities for copying or collaboration. On some occasions it will be useful to include supervised production of evidence. Where appropriate, practical activities or performance observed by the Assessor should be included.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Learners must authenticate the evidence that they provide for assessment. They do this by signing a declaration stating that it is their own work when they submit it. For practical or performance tasks observed by the Assessor this is not necessary.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Your Assessors should assess only learner evidence that is authentic. If they find through the assessment process that some or all of the evidence is not authentic, they need to take appropriate action, including invoking malpractice policies as required.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>It is important that all evidence can be validated through verification. This means that it must be capable of being reassessed in full by another person. When you are using practical and performance evidence, you need to think about how supporting evidence can be captured through using, for example, videos, recordings, photographs, handouts, task sheets etc.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The authentication of learner evidence is the responsibility of your centre. If during external sampling an Edexcel Standards Verifier raises concerns about the authenticity of evidence, your centre will be required to investigate further. Depending on the outcomes, penalties may be applied. At the end of this section, you can find an example of a template that can be used to record the declaration of learners in relation to the authenticity of the evidence presented for assessment.</paragraph>

            <title>Applying criteria to internal assessments</title>
            <text>
                <paragraph>Each unit and learning aim has specified assessment criteria. Your centre should use these criteria for assessing the quality of the evidence provided. This determines the grade awarded.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The assessment criteria are not a set of sequential activities but a way of making a judgement. For example, if a Level 2 Pass specifies a ‘description’ and a Merit an ‘analysis’, these do not require two different activities but rather one activity through which some learners will provide only description evidence and others will also provide analysis evidence.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The assessment criteria are hierarchical. A learner can achieve a Merit only if they provide sufficient evidence for the Level 2 Pass and Merit criteria. Similarly, a learner can achieve a Distinction only if they give sufficient evidence for the Level 2 Pass, Merit and Distinction criteria.</paragraph> 
                <describedlist>
                    <list_description>A summative unit grade is awarded after all opportunities for achievement are given. A learner must achieve all the assessment criteria for that grade. Therefore:</list_description>

            <text>
                <paragraph>You should encourage learners to understand the importance of deadlines and of handing work in on time. For assessment purposes it is important that learners are assessed fairly and consistently according to the assessment plan that the Lead Internal Verifier has authorised and that some learners are not advantaged by 
                    having additional time to complete assignments. You are not required to accept 
                    assessment work that was not completed by the date in the assessment plan.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>Learners may be given authorised extensions for legitimate reasons, such as illness at the time of submission. If you accept a late completion by a learner, the evidence should be assessed normally, unless it is judged to not meet the requirements for authenticity. It is not appropriate, however, to give automatic downgrades on assessment decisions as ‘punishment’ for late submission.</paragraph>

            <title>Opportunities to retake assessments</title>
            <text>
                <paragraph>Summative assessment is the culmination of the learning and assessment process. 
                    You should make sure that learners have sufficient learning and preparation before undertaking assessment. Formative feedback during an assessment window will help 
                    a learner demonstrate attainment to the best of their abilities.
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>A learner may be given one opportunity to retake a completed assessment after a summative grade has been given. Your centre will need to provide a specific assessment opportunity that is authorised by the Lead Internal Verifier. You should make arrangements for retaking the assessment in such a way that does not adversely affect other assessments and does not give the learner an unfair advantage over other learners. You need to consider how the further assessment opportunity ensures that assessment remains fit for purpose and in line with the original requirements.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The centre may conduct a retake under supervised conditions even if this was not necessary for the original assessment.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>As a centre you need to be fair to all learners in the way in which you provide opportunities to retake assessments, and you are not required to make an opportunity available if your learner has not taken full advantage of the first assessment opportunity and formative assessment process.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The original evidence for assessment may remain valid and can be extended, or it may need to be replaced partially or in full. The learner must not have further teacher guidance and support in producing further evidence.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The Edexcel Standards Verifier is likely to want to include assessments that have been resubmitted as part of the sample they will review.</paragraph>

These appeals may relate to assessment decisions being incorrect or assessment not being conducted fairly. The first step in such a policy would be a consideration of the evidence by a Lead Internal Verifier or other member of the programme team. The assessment plan should allow time for potential appeals after assessment decisions have been given to learners.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>If there is an appeal by a learner you must document the appeal and its resolution.</paragraph>

In most instances this can be achieved simply by application of the policy, for example to extend time or adjust the format of evidence. We can advise you if you are uncertain as to whether an adjustment is fair and reasonable.

                <paragraph>You must operate special consideration in line with Edexcel’s Reasonable Adjustments and Special Considerations Policy for Vocational Qualifications. You can provide special consideration only in the time given for evidence to be provided or for the format of the assessment if it is equally valid. You may not substitute alternative forms of evidence to that required 
                    in a unit, or omit the application of any assessment criteria to judge attainment. Edexcel can consider applications for special consideration in line with the policy.
