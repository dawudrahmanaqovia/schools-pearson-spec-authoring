        <title>What are BTEC firsts?</title>
        <text>
            <paragraph>BTEC First qualifications were originally designed for use in colleges, schools and the workplace as an introductory level 2 course for learners wanting to study in the context of a vocational sector. This is still relevant today. The knowledge, understanding and skills learned in studying a BTEC First will aid progression to further study and prepare learners to enter the workplace in due course. Potential employment opportunities, such as an apprenticeship or a supervised role (depending on the specific job requirements), should be available in the information technology sector and appropriate parts of the creative industries, such as computer games development. These BTEC First qualifications provide learners with a taste of what these sectors can offer, enabling them to make informed choices about their future career.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>These qualifications are intended primarily for learners in the 14–19 age group, but may also be used by other learners who wish to gain an introductory understanding 
                of a vocational area. When taken as part of a balanced curriculum, there is a clear progression route to a level 3 course or an apprenticeship. 
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>BTECs are vocationally related qualifications, where learners develop knowledge 
                and understanding by applying their learning and skills in a work-related context. Additionally, they are popular and effective because they engage learners to take responsibility for their own learning and to develop skills that are essential for the modern-day workplace. These skills include: teamworking; working from a prescribed brief; working to deadlines; presenting information effectively; and accurately completing administrative tasks and processes. BTEC Firsts motivate learners, and open doors to progression into further study and responsibility within the workplace.
            </paragraph>
            <paragraph>The BTEC First suite continues to reflect this ethos and builds on the recommendations outlined in the Review of Vocational Education – The Wolf Report (March 2011) and further emphasised in the Department for Education’s Study Programmes for 16–19 year olds consultation (June 2012). These reports confirmed the importance of a broad and balanced curriculum for all learners.</paragraph>
