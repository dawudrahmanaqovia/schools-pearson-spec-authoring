                <text>
                    <paragraph>This table shows where a learning aim in a unit is of particular relevance for the learners being prepared for assessment in Functional Skills in English, mathematics and/or ICT at level 2. Centres may identify further opportunities arising in their own programmes in addition to those identified below, for example, group work, research, employment-related activities
                        and work experience.</paragraph>
                    <paragraph><strong>Key:</strong> a letter A, B, C and/or D indicates the learning aim where there are opportunities for development; a blank space indicates no opportunities for development</paragraph>
