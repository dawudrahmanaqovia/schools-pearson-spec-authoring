            <text>
                <paragraph>
                    <strong>A FRAMEWORK OF PERSONAL, LEARNING AND THINKING SKILLS 11–19 IN ENGLAND </strong>
                </paragraph>
                <paragraph>Source – QCDA (archived)</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The framework comprises six groups of skills that are essential to success in learning, life and work. In essence, the framework captures the essential skills of: managing self; managing relationships with others; and managing own learning, performance and work. It is these skills that will enable young people to enter work and adult life confident and
                    capable.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The titles of the six groups of skills are set out below.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>For each group, there is a focus statement that sums up the range of skills. This is followed by a set of outcome statements that is indicative of the skills, behaviours and personal qualities associated with each group.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Each group is distinctive and coherent. The groups are also interconnected. Young people are likely to encounter skills from several groups in any one learning experience. For example, an independent enquirer would set goals for their research with clear success criteria (reflective learner) and organise and manage their time and resources effectively to achieve these
                    (self-manager). In order to acquire and develop fundamental concepts such as organising oneself, managing change, taking responsibility and perseverance, learners will need to apply skills from all six groups in a wide range of learning contexts.</paragraph>
