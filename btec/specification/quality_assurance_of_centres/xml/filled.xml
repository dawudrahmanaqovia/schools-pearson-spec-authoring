            <paragraph>Edexcel will produce on an annual basis the BTEC Quality Assurance Handbook, which will contain detailed guidance on the quality processes required to underpin robust assessment and internal verification.</paragraph>

                <list_description>The key principles of quality assurance are that:</list_description>

                        <paragraph>a centre delivering BTEC programmes must be an approved centre, and must have approval for the programmes or groups of programmes that it is delivering</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>the centre agrees, as part of gaining approval, to abide by specific terms and conditions around the effective delivery and quality assurance of assessment;it must abide by these conditions throughout the period of delivery</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Edexcel makes available to approved centres a range of materials and opportunities, through online standardisation, intended to exemplify the processes required for effective assessment, and examples of effective standards. Approved centres must use the materials and services to ensure that all staff delivering BTEC qualifications keep up to date with the guidance on assessment</paragraph>

                    <item>
                        <paragraph>an approved centre must follow agreed protocols for standardisation of assessors and verifiers, for the planning, monitoring and recording of assessment processes, and for dealing with special circumstances, appeals and malpractice.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The approach of quality-assured assessment is through a partnership between an approved centre and Edexcel. We will make sure that each centre follows best practice and employs appropriate technology to support quality-assurance processes, where practicable. We work to support centres and seek to make sure that our quality-assurance processes do not place undue bureaucratic processes on centres.</paragraph>
            <describedlist>
                <list_description>We monitor and support centres in the effective operation of assessment and quality assurance. The methods we use to do this for BTEC First programmes include:</list_description>

            <paragraph>An approved centre must make certification claims only when authorised by us and strictly in accordance with requirements for reporting.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Centres that do not fully address and maintain rigorous approaches to quality assurance cannot seek certification for individual programmes or for all BTEC First programmes. Centres that do not comply with remedial action plans may have their approval to deliver qualifications removed.</paragraph>
