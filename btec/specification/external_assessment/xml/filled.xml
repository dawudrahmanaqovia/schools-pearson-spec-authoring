                    <paragraph>Each internally assessed unit has specific assessment criteria that your centre must use to judge learner work in order to arrive at a grading decision for the unit as a whole. For internally assessed units, the assessor judges the evidence that the learner has presented to determine whether it meets all the relevant criteria, and then awards a grade at the appropriate level.</paragraph>

They will be able to define and communicate key aspects of technical knowledge, selecting appropriate actions in more simple and familiar contexts. They will be able to relate their knowledge and understanding to vocational contexts, making some decisions on valid application and impact.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Learners are able to synthesise knowledge of information technology and creative technology, bringing together understanding of their uses and limitations and applying them to sometimes complex contexts in defined vocational scenarios. They should demonstrate depth of knowledge of the technical components of computing systems and relevant processes. Learners will understand how and when to use their knowledge in different situations, being able to make effective judgements based on analysis of given information. They will be able to analyse information and data, selecting the most relevant concepts and making valid decisions about the selection and application of systems and software. They can judge the consequences of effective and ineffective uses of computer systems and software, and make recommendations on solutions and future actions. They can compare methods and approaches used to construct, use and apply computer systems, and evaluate alternatives against defined criteria.</paragraph>
