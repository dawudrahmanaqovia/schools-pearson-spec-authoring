				<h3>Welcome to your BTEC First 2012 specification</h3>
				<p>
					For more than 25 years, BTECs have earned their reputation as well-established,
					enduringly effective qualifications. They have a proven track record in improving
					motivation and achievement among young learners. Additionally, BTECs provide
					progression routes to the next stage of education or into employment.
				</p>
				<h4>BTECs are evolving</h4>
				<p>
					Informed by recent policy developments, including the <em>Review of Vocational
					Education - The Wolf Report</em> (March 2011), we have designed this new suite of
					BTEC Firsts to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>ensure high quality and rigorous standards</li>
					<li>conform to quality criteria for non-GCSE qualifications</li>
					<li>be fit for purpose for learners, pre- or post-16, in schools and in colleges.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We conducted in-depth, independent consultations with schools, colleges, higher
					education, employers, the Association of Colleges and other professional
					organisations. This new suite builds on the qualities - such as a clear vocational
					context for learning and teacher-led assessment based on centre-devised
					assignments - that you told us make BTECs so effective and engaging.
				</p>
				<p>
					This new suite introduces features to meet the needs of educators, employers and
					the external environment. They are fully aligned with requirements for progression -
					to further study at level 3, into an apprenticeship or into the workplace. We believe
					these features will make BTEC even stronger and more highly valued.
				</p>
				<h4>What are the key principles of the new suite of BTEC Firsts?</h4>
				<p>
					To support young people to succeed and progress in their education, we have drawn
					on our consultations with you and embedded four key design principles into the new
					BTEC Firsts.
				</p>
				<h6>1 Standards: a common core and external assessment</h6>
				<p>
					Each new Level 2 BTEC First qualification has an essential core of knowledge and
					applied skills. We have introduced external assessment appropriate to the sector.
					This provides independent evidence of learning and progression alongside the
					predominantly portfolio-based assessment.
				</p>
				<h6>2 Quality: a robust quality-assurance model</h6>
				<p>
					Building on strong foundations, we have further developed our quality-assurance
					model to ensure robust support for learners, centres and assessors.
				</p>
				<p>We will make sure that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>every BTEC learner's work is independently scrutinised through the external assessment process</li>
					<li>every BTEC assessor will take part in a sampling and quality review during the teaching cycle</li>
					<li>we visit each BTEC centre every year to review and support your quality processes.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We believe this combination of rigour, dialogue and support will underpin the validity
					of the teacher-led assessment and the learner-centric approach that lie at the heart
					of BTEC learning.
				</p>
				<hgroup>
					<h6><span>3</span> Breadth and progression: a range of options building on the core units; contextualised English and mathematics</h6>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					The <strong>essential core</strong>, developed in consultation with employers and educators, gives
					learners the opportunity to gain a broad understanding and knowledge of a
					vocational sector.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <strong>mandatory unit(s)</strong> assesses knowledge, understanding and skills that are not
					covered within the core units but are essential to the curriculum area or vocational
					industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					The <strong>optional specialist units</strong> provide a closer focus on a vocational area,
					supporting progression into a more specialised level 3 vocational or academic course
					or into an apprenticeship.	
				</p>
				<p>
					Opportunities to develop skills in English and mathematics are indicated in the units
					where appropriate. These give learners the opportunity to practise these essential
					skills in naturally occurring and meaningful contexts, where appropriate to the
					industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					The skills have been mapped against GCSE (including functional elements) English
					and mathematics subject content areas.
				</p>
				<h6>4 Recognising achievement: opportunity to achieve at level 1</h6>
				<p>
					The new BTEC Firsts are level 2 qualifications with Pass, Merit, Distinction
					and Distinction* grades.
				</p>		
				<p>
					However, we recognise that some learners may fail to achieve a Pass at Level 2,
					so we have included the opportunity for learners to gain a level 1 qualification.	
				</p>	
				<h4>Improved specification and support</h4>
				<p>
					In our consultation, we also asked about what kind of guidance you, as teachers and
					tutors, need. As a result, we have streamlined the specification itself to make the
					units easier to navigate, and provided enhanced support in the accompanying
					Delivery Guide.
				</p>
				<h4>Thank you</h4>
				<p>
					Finally, we would like to extend our thanks to everyone who provided support and
					feedback during the development of the new BTEC Firsts, particularly all of you who
					gave up many evenings of your own time to share your advice and experiences to
					shape these new qualifications. We hope you enjoy teaching the course.

				<hgroup>
					<h3><span>1</span> What are BTEC Firsts?</h3>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					BTEC First qualifications were originally designed for use in colleges, schools and
					the workplace as an introductory level 2 course for learners wanting to study in
					the context of a vocational sector. This is still relevant today. The knowledge,
					understanding and skills learnt in studying a BTEC First will aid progression to
					further study and prepare learners to enter the workplace in due course. Potential
					employment opportunities, such as an apprenticeship or a supervised role
					(depending on the specific job requirements) should be available in the information
					technology sector and appropriate parts of the creative industries, such as computer
					games development. These BTEC First qualifications provide learners with a taste of
					what these sectors can offer, enabling them to make informed choices about their
					future career.			
				</p>
				<p>
					These qualifications are intended primarily for learners in the 14-19 age group, but
					may also be used by other learners who wish to gain an introductory understanding
					of a vocational area. When taken as part of a balanced curriculum, there is a clear
					progression route to a level 3 course or to an apprenticeship.			
				</p>
				<p>
					BTECs are vocationally related qualifications, where learners develop knowledge
					and understanding by applying their learning and skills in a work-related context.
					Additionally, they are popular and effective because they engage learners to take
					responsibility for their own learning and to develop skills that are essential for the
					modern-day workplace. These skills include: teamworking; working from a prescribed
					brief; working to deadlines; presenting information effectively; and accurately
					completing administrative tasks and processes. BTEC Firsts motivate young learners,
					and open doors to progression into further study and responsibility within the
					workplace.			
				</p>
				<p>
					The BTEC First suite continues to reflect this ethos and builds on the
					recommendations outlined in the <em>Review of Vocational Education - The Wolf Report</em>
					(March 2011). That report confirmed the importance of a broad and balanced
					curriculum for learners.

					<h3><span>3</span>Edexcel BTEC Level 1/ Level 2 First Certificate and Extended Certificate in Information and Creative Technology</h3>
				</hgroup>
				<p>The rationale for all the qualifications in the BTEC First suite is to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>inspire and enthuse learners to become technology savvy - producers of technology products and systems, rather than just consumers of them</li>
					<li>give learners the opportunity to gain a broad understanding and knowledge of, and skills in, the Information Technology sector and some aspects of the creative industries, e.g. computer games development</li>
					<li>allow for a flexible choice of units to meet the needs of learners with different interests and inclinations by offering four different pathways</li>
					<li>support progression to a more specialised level 3 vocational or academic computing course, or to an Information Technology apprenticeship</li>
					<li>give learners the potential opportunity, in due course, to enter employment within a wide range of junior job roles across the Information Technology sector and some aspects of the creative industries. Junior job roles include: Software Engineer, Website Content Manager, Computer Animator, Help Desk Support and Graphic Designer.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The revised title of the qualification reflects the emphasis on the 'creativity' required
					by learners to create/develop computer-based products or systems.				
				</p>
				<p>
					Within the suite, the <strong>Edexcel BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First Certificate and
					Extended Certificate in Information and Creative Technology</strong> qualifications
					have been developed to meet the needs of learners with a range of educational
					requirements. These include learners who:				
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>wish to add breadth to their knowledge and understanding of the sector as part of their career progression and development plans</li>
					<li>have had some achievement in their Key Stage 4 programme and wish to top-up their Level 2 achievement to progress to employment or other qualifications</li>
					<li>are working towards achieving Level 2 English and/or Mathematics qualifications in a post-16 setting and wish to complement their study programme with a qualification that supports preparation for work or progression.</li>
				</ul>
				<h6>The Edexcel BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First Certificate (240 GLH)</h6>
				<p>
					The core units form the fundamental knowledge and understanding of IT/computing
					principles and, when completed, provide synoptic coverage of the qualification. In
					addition, centres have the flexibility to select optional specialist units to reflect the
					breadth of opportunity within the sector and enable further exploration of specific
					areas of interest. These units combine to provide the following four pathways:				
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information Technology (e.g. Unit 1: The Online World, Unit 3: A Digital Portfolio and Unit 13: Database Development)</li>
					<li>Computer science (e.g. Unit 2: Technology Systems, Unit 3: A Digital Portfolio and Unit 12: Software Development)</li>
					<li>Creative technology (e.g. Unit 1: The Online World, Unit 3: A Digital Portfolio, Unit 5: Creating Digital Graphics, Unit 4: Creating Digital Animations)</li>
					<li>Computer systems development and maintenance (e.g. Unit 1: The Online World, Unit 3: A Digital Portfolio, Unit 11: Computer Networks)</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Assessment approach</h5>
				<p>
					The Edexcel BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First Certificate and Extended Certificate in Information
					and Creative Technology include two externally assessed units in the core to introduce
					externality into vocational programmes of study. This will assist learners as they progress
					either into higher levels of vocational learning or to related academic qualifications, such
					as GCSEs and GCEs.
				</p>
				<p>
					The assessment approach for the internally assessed units in the qualification structure
					enables learners to receive feedback on their progress throughout the course as they
					provide evidence towards meeting the unit assessment criteria. These units include a
					Digital Portfolio unit (Unit 3), which is assessed synoptically, and must include learner's
					work from all complete units from their course. Internally assessed units (optional
					specialist units) provide a common approach to understanding existing technology
					products/systems through investigation, and then allow learners to design, make
					and review their own technology-based product or system.
				</p>
				<p>
					Delivery strategies should reflect the nature of work within the IT sector by encouraging
					learners to research and carry out assessment in the workplace, or in simulated working
					conditions, wherever possible. It will be beneficial to learners to use locally available
					vocational examples wherever possible, and for your centre to engage with local
					employers for support and input. This allows a more realistic and motivating basis
					for learning, and can start to ensure that learning serves the needs of local areas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Learners should be encouraged to take responsibility for their own learning and
					achievement, taking account of the industry standards for behaviour and performance.
				</p>
				<h5>Progression opportunities</h5>
				<p>
					The Edexcel BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First Certificate and Extended Certificate in
					Information and Creative Technology provides the knowledge, understanding and
					skills for level 2 learners to progress to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>other level 2 vocational qualifications</li>
					<li>level 3 qualifications, such as BTEC Nationals, specifically the Edexcel BTEC Level 3 in IT (QCF) or an IT/Creative Media apprenticeship</li>
					<li>academic qualifications, such as GCE in ICT or Computing</li>
					<li>employment within the information technology industry and/or areas within the creative industries, such as developing computer animations</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Learners who achieve the qualification at Level 1 may progress to the Level 2
					Certificate or Extended Certificate, or to academic or other vocational Level 2
					qualifications.
				</p>
				<h6>Developing employability skills</h6>
				<p>
					One of the main purposes of BTEC qualifications is to help learners to progress
					ultimately into employment. The vast majority of employers require learners to have
					certain technical skills, knowledge and understanding to work in a particular sector,
					but they are also looking for employability skills to ensure that employees are
					effective in the workplace.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unlike technical skills, which may become outdated over time, employability skills
					enable learners to adapt to the ever-changing roles needed to survive in the global
					economy. These skills include: self-management, team working, business awareness,
					problem solving, communication, basic literacy and numeracy, a positive attitude to
					work, and the use of IT.
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout the BTEC First in Information and Creative Technology learners should
					develop a range of employability skills. For example, across all the optional specialist
					units learners develop:			
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>project-/self-management and independent-learning skills, as each unit is an individual project or forms part of a larger project</li>
					<li>communication skills, such as when producing design documentation and when obtaining evaluative feedback on products or systems produced</li>
					<li>business awareness, as assignments are set in a vocational context</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Stakeholder support</h5>
				<p>
					The Edexcel BTEC First Level 1/Level 2 Certificate and Extended Certificate in Information
					and Creative Technology reflect the needs of employers, further and higher education
					representatives, and professional organisations. Key stakeholders were consulted during
					the development of these qualifications.

				</hgroup>
				<p>The awarding and certification of these qualifications will comply with the requirements of the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual).</p>
				<h4>Calculation of the qualification grade</h4>
				<p>These qualifications are level 2 qualifications, and the certification for each qualification may show a grade ranging from Level 2 PP to Level 2 D*D*. (Please refer to the Calculation of qualification grade table for the full list of grades.&#134;)</p>
				<p>If these are not achieved, a Level 1 grade may be awarded. Learners whose level of achievement is below a Level 1 will receive an Unclassified (U) result.</p>
				<p>The qualification grade is calculated on the basis of grades in individual units. Each unit will be awarded a grade of Level 2 Pass, Level 2 Merit, Level 2 Distinction or Level 1. Learners whose level of achievement is below a Level 1 will receive an Unclassified (U) for that unit. There is no unit grade of D*; grades of D*D and D*D* can be awarded as an aggregated grade for the qualification based on the learner's overall performance. In order to achieve this grade, learners will have to demonstrate a strong performance across the qualification as a whole.</p>
				<p>To achieve a level 2 qualification, learners must:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>complete and report an outcome for all units within the permitted combination (NB Unclassified is a permitted unit outcome), and</li>
					<li>have sufficient points across Unit 3 and either Unit 1 or Unit 2, i.e. a minimum of 24 points, and</li>
					<li>achieve the minimum number of points at a grade threshold from the permitted combination. (See the Calculation of qualification grade table. For comparison, the table includes all qualification sizes in the suite.)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Learners who do not achieve a Level 2 may be entitled to achieve a Level 1 where they:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>complete and report an outcome for all units within the permitted combination (NB Unclassified is a permitted unit outcome), and</li>
					<li>have sufficient points across Unit 3 and either Unit 1 or Unit 2, i.e. a minimum of 12 points, and</li>
					<li>achieve the minimum number of points for a Level 1. (See the Calculation of qualification grade table. For comparison, the table includes all qualification sizes in the suite.)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Learners who fail to reach the minimum standard for a Level 1 to be awarded will be recorded as Unclassified (U) and will not be certificated.</p>
				<p>It is the responsibility of a centre to ensure that the correct unit combination is adhered to.</p>
				<p>Learners who do not achieve sufficient points for the Certificate or Extended Certificate qualifications may be eligible to achieve the Award provided they have sufficient points across the core units, have completed the correct combination of units and meet the appropriate qualification grade points threshold.</p>
				<p><small>&#134; The <em>Calculation of qualification grade</em> table provides centres with guidance on the performance levels expected for the award of individual grades. Grade thresholds may be reviewed based on unit grade performance.</small></p>

				<h4>Unit Introduction</h4>
				<p>Technology systems are involved in many of the objects we use every day, from
				a laptop computer and routers relaying internet traffic, to logging in to a social
				networking site. This unit provides a first look at how the main building blocks of
				technology systems work.</p>
				
				<p>You will explore the common hardware components of technology systems, such as
				a touch screen or a printer, and the internal building blocks of a computer like the
				processor, buses and memory. The unit also covers the purpose of networks, which
				allow different devices within a technology system to communicate. (This topic is
				covered in more detail in Unit 1: The Online World and Unit 11: Computer Networks.)</p>
				
				<p>No technology system is complete without the software that brings it to life. You will
				explore different types of software. These will include the operating system (OS) that
				supports the communication and management of resources, and utility programs that
				provide functionality to maintain the system.
				You will also learn about the role of applications software, such as office programs,
				graphics packages, accounting software and CAD/CAM, that supports many aspects
				of everyday business life.</p>
				
				<p>  This unit supports all of the optional specialist units in the Award, especially Unit 8:
				Mobile Apps Development, Unit 9: Spreadsheet Development, Unit 10: Database
				Development, Unit 11: Computer Networks, Unit 12: Software Development
				and Unit 13: Website Development.</p>
				
				<p>
				This unit is particularly useful if you are considering a career in the IT sector,
				as it includes key concepts and processes which form the basis of any technology
				system and is relevant for many roles in the industry.</p>

				<h4>Unit Introduction</h4>
				<p>
					When you play computer games, visit exhibitions, or go shopping online you will
					experience multimedia in action. You will also encounter it every time you watch a
					DVD, use online learning materials or visit a social networking site.
				</p>				
				<p>
					Multimedia plays an ever expanding and increasingly important role in daily life. It
					allows you to access information in new and inspiring ways, using combinations of
					assets such as video, sound effects, music, animation, images and text to create
					interactive products that are stimulating and easy to use. Relevant job roles include
					multimedia specialists who use software to manipulate assets into products and
					software developers/programmers who add functionality by writing computer code.
				</p>				
				<p>
					To be successful, a multimedia product must be suitable for the intended purpose
					and audience (for a linear product) or user requirements (for an interactive product).
					It must also be visually interesting, retain attention and present an intuitive interface
					that you will not need to learn, but instinctively know how to use.
				</p>				
				<p>
					Multimedia products include interactive presentations, information points and virtual
					reality simulations, as well as computer-based games and movies. These products
					have massive markets and there is real demand for people with the imagination and
					appropriate technical skills to create them.
				</p>				
				<p>
					In this unit, you will understand how multimedia products are used and the typical
					features they contain. You will be able to apply some of your findings when creating
					your own multimedia products. You will design, develop and test your own
					multimedia products against a brief.
				</p>
				<p>Once completed you will review your work and obtain feedback from others.</p>
				<p>
					In particular, this unit develops skills from Unit 1: The Online World, Unit 4: Creating
					Digital Animation, Unit 5: Creating Digital Audio, Unit 6: Creating Digital Graphics
					and Unit 7: Creating Digital Video. Unit 12: Software Development will also
					complement the content of this unit.

					<h5>Suggested assignment outlines</h5>
					<p>The table below shows a programme of suggested assignment outlines that cover the assessment criteria. This is guidance and it is recommended that centres either write their own assignments or adapt any assignments we provide to meet local needs and resources.</p>
					<h6>Brief 1</h6>
					<p>
						Design, develop and test a multimedia presentation intended to introduce the work of a charity concerned with the conservation of the
						rainforest. The presentation should be aimed at Key Stage 4 school pupils. It should be designed to inform them of the problems
						associated with the loss of the rainforest. The presentation is to be shown in school classrooms, using a large screen and data projector.
						The final presentation must include a list of all the digital assets used in its development.
					</p>
					<h6>Brief 2</h6>
					<p>
						Design, develop and test a simple, single player computer game based on a maze. The game should be fun to play, aimed at Key Stage 2
						children and maintain interest by incorporating levels of increasing difficulty. The game is to be played on laptops and standard PCs and
						should include user instructions on game play.

				<h4>Synoptic assessment</h4>
				<p>
					Synoptic assessment in information and creative technology is embedded throughout
					the units of study. The external units provide the essential knowledge, understanding
					and skills required in the subject and underpin the content of the optional specialist
					units. Learners studying the Edexcel BTEC Level 1/Level 2 First in Information and
					Creative Technology are able to demonstrate a number of synoptic approaches
					towards meeting the assessment criteria, including:			
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>showing links and holistic understanding/approaches to several units of study from the specification</li>
					<li>undertaking <em>Unit 3: A Digital Portfolio</em>, using work from all the completed units to build their digital portfolio</li>
					<li>interrelating overarching concepts and issues, bringing together their knowledge of information and creative technology</li>
					<li>developing an appreciation of how topics relate to one another, and how each may contribute to different uses and applications of technology</li>
					<li>making and applying connections to particular technology situations</li>
					<li>demonstrating their ability to use and apply a range of different methods and/or techniques</li>
					<li>being able to suggest or apply different approaches to contexts, situations, or in the effective tackling of specific technology-related problems</li>
					<li>synthesising information gained from studying a number of different technologybased activities</li>
					<li>using specialist terminology where appropriate</li>
					<li>demonstrating use of transferable skills, e.g. communication skills and business awareness</li>
					<li>demonstrating analytical and interpretation skills (of situations and/or results) and the ability to formulate valid well-argued responses</li>
					<li>evaluating and justifying their decisions, choices and recommendations.</li>
				</ul>
				<h6>Examples</h6>
				<ol class="number-list">
					<li>
						In the synoptic unit, Unit 3: A Digital Portfolio, learners reflect on their learning
						and identify connections from across their programme of study, such as problemsolving
						techniques and digital communication methods. The portfolio must include
						work from <strong>all</strong> the units they have completed in the course.
					</li>
					<li>
						All optional specialist units follow the same project life cycle to investigate
						existing technology, and then to design, create/develop, test and review either a
						computer-based product or a system.
					</li>
					<li>
						Different units support and develop from each other. For example,
						<ol>
							<li>
								Unit 2: Technology Systems supports Unit 8: Mobile Apps Development,
								Unit 12: Software Development and Unit 16: Automated Systems Development
								as it provides an introduction to programming
							</li>
							<li>
								Unit 5: Creating Digital Audio and Unit 6: Creating Digital Graphics support
								Unit 4: Creating Digital Animation as these technologies are used in the
								creation of computer animations
							</li>
							<li>
								Unit 17: Multimedia Products Development develops the learning from all four
								of the 'Creating Digital' units (Units 4, 5, 6 and 7).
							</li>
